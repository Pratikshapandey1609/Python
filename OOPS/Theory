"OOPs" in Python refers to Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that structures code around the concept of "objects," which are instances of "classes." This approach aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within a program.

1) Classes and objects
2) Encapsulations
3) Inheritance
4) Polymorphism 
5) Abstraction


--------- Features --------------> : 

1) Modularity:
Code is organized into independent, reusable units (objects).

2) Reusability:
Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of a program or in other projects.

3) Maintainability:
Changes in one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts due to encapsulation.

4) Scalability:
OOP facilitates the development of large and complex applications by breaking them down into manageable components.

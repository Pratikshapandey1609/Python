'''
a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object of a class. 
It is automatically called when an object is instantiated. The primary purpose of a constructor is to set up 
the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes or performing any necessary setup logi

Key aspects of constructors in Python:-----

__init__ method:
This is the designated method for defining a constructor. It is a "dunder" method (double underscores) 
and is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created.

self parameter:
The first parameter of the __init__ method must always be self. 
This refers to the instance of the object being created, allowing 
you to access and modify its attributes.


Types of constructors: -----------

Default Constructor: (self)
If no __init__ method is explicitly defined in a class, 
Python provides a default constructor that does nothing.
(self)

Parameterized Constructor: (Self , name , age)
This type of constructor takes additional parameters beyond self to allow for 
the initialization of object attributes with specific values provided during object creation.

constructor with values (self , name='guest , age = 0)

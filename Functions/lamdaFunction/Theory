In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined 
using the lambda keyword. 
Unlike standard functions defined with def, lambda functions do not 
have a name and are typically used for short, 
one-time operations

Key characteristics of lambda functions:

1) Anonymous: They are not assigned a name, hence "anonymous."

2) Single Expression: A lambda function can take any number of arguments but can only 
   contain one expression,which is evaluated and returned implicitly.

3) Concise: They offer a compact syntax for simple functions, often used inline.

4) Commonly used with Higher-Order Functions: Lambda functions are frequently 
   employed as arguments to functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(), which take other functions as arguments.

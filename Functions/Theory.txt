Functions in Python are self-contained blocks of code designed to perform 
a specific task. They are fundamental for organizing code, 

promoting reusability, 
improving readability 
maintainability. 

Defining a Function :---
Functions are defined using the [def keyword], followed by the function name, 
parentheses for parameters, and a colon. The function's code block is indented.

def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # Function body
    # Perform operations
    return result # Optional: return a value

Types of Functions: -----------------

1) Built-in Functions:
    These are functions pre-defined in Python, 
    such as print(), len(), abs(), int(), etc.

2) User-defined Functions:
   These are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks 
   tailored to their program's needs.
3) Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions):
   These are small, single-expression functions defined using the lambda keyword,
   often used for concise operations or as arguments to higher-order functions 
   like map(), filter(), or reduce().

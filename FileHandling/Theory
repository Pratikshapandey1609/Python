File handling in Python involves interacting with files on a computer's file system, 
allowing for operations such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files. This process is essential for data persistence, enabling programs to store and retrieve information beyond their execution time.

Key Concepts:-------> 

Opening a File: The open() function is used to open a file. 
It takes the file path and the desired mode as arguments.

file_object = open("filename.txt", "mode")

filename.txt: The name and path of the file to be opened.
mode: Specifies how the file will be accessed (e.g., read, write, append).


File Modes:

Different modes dictate the operations allowed on a file:

'r' (Read): Opens a file for reading (default mode).
'w' (Write): Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist, otherwise overwrites existing content.
'a' (Append): Opens a file for appending new data to the end. Creates a new file if it doesn't exist. 
'x' (Exclusive Creation): Creates a new file, raising an error if the file already exists.
'b' (Binary): Used for binary files (e.g., images, audio).
't' (Text): Used for text files (default for non-binary modes).
'+' (Read/Write): Can be combined with other modes (e.g., 'r+', 'w+', 'a+') to allow both reading and writing.

2 primary files : 

1) text files (.txt , .csv)
2) binart files (non text files .mp3 )
